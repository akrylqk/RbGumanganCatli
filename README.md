# Music by the Decades

Our proposal is to create a small website with the 3 best albums of a particular decade. For the purpose of this project, I'm going to choose the 2010s, the 2000s, the 90s, and the 80s, as those years have been very pivotal for music and I've listened to a lot of albums from that time period.

The main concept is that the main page has four buttons, each leading to the list for their respective decade. Each page has 3 albums, and when you hover over the album cover it reveals a write up text box made with css.
