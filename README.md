# Music by the Decades

Our proposal is to create a small website with the 5 best albums of a particular decade. For the purpose of this project, I'm going to choose the 2010s, the 2000s, the 90s, and the 80s. The main page will have 4 buttons, each leading to a separate page for their respective decade. Each page will have a title, a table of contents with hyperlinks to jump to different parts of the page (to reach different albums easily), and finally the album descriptions themselves, with a picture of the album cover and a quick but detailed description that shows why the specified album is highly regarded.
